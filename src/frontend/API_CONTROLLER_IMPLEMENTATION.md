# API Controller Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive API controller system to prevent unnecessary backend calls based on game phase, particularly addressing the issue of API spam during the WAITING (LOBBY) phase.

## Key Components

### 1. API Controller Service (`src/services/apiController.ts`)
- **Phase-based Permissions**: Blocks API calls during LOBBY, PREPARATION, GAME_OVER, and ENDED phases
- **Rate Limiting**: Enforces a 30-second minimum interval between proof generations
- **Statistics Tracking**: Monitors total calls, blocked calls, and calls by phase
- **Error Handling**: Returns appropriate error messages when calls are blocked

### 2. Controlled API Functions
- `generateLocationProofControlled()`: Wraps proof generation with phase checks
- `verifyLocationProofControlled()`: Wraps proof verification with phase checks

### 3. React Hook (`src/hooks/useAPIController.ts`)
- Syncs game phase with API controller automatically
- Provides real-time statistics and status
- Offers convenient access to controller state

### 4. UI Component (`src/components/ui/APIControllerStatus.tsx`)
- Displays current phase and API permissions
- Shows blocked/allowed call statistics
- Provides visual feedback for API restrictions
- Available in both compact and full display modes

### 5. Demo Component (`src/components/demo/APIControllerDemo.tsx`)
- Interactive demonstration of API controller functionality
- Test button to trigger API calls and see blocking in action
- Clear visual feedback on why calls are blocked

## Phase Permissions

| Game Phase | API Calls Allowed |
|------------|-------------------|
| LOBBY | ❌ None |
| PREPARATION | ❌ None |
| ACTIVE | ✅ generateProof, verifyProof |
| SHRINKING | ✅ generateProof, verifyProof |
| ZONE_SHRINKING | ✅ generateProof, verifyProof |
| FINAL_ZONE | ✅ generateProof, verifyProof |
| GAME_OVER | ❌ None |
| ENDED | ❌ None |

## Updated Components
1. **useLocationProof Hook**: Now uses controlled API functions
2. **GameEngine**: Uses controlled proof generation
3. **Test Mocks**: Added comprehensive mocking for tests

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { useAPIController } from '@/hooks/useAPIController';
import { APIControllerStatus } from '@/components/ui';

function MyComponent() {
  const { isProofAllowed, stats } = useAPIController();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <APIControllerStatus compact />
      {!isProofAllowed && (
        <p>API calls blocked - game not active</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Benefits
1. **Prevents Backend Spam**: No unnecessary API calls during waiting phases
2. **Better User Experience**: Clear feedback about why operations are blocked
3. **Centralized Control**: Single source of truth for API permissions
4. **Easy Integration**: Drop-in replacement for direct API calls
5. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Track all API usage patterns

## Implementation Notes
- The API controller is a singleton service
- Game phase is automatically synced via the useAPIController hook
- All blocked calls are logged with clear reasons
- The 30-second proof interval prevents rapid successive calls
- Mock implementation provided for testing environments
